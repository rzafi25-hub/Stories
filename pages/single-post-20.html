                <ul class="cruise__content-list">
                    <li>As a beauty reporter, I've tried every product in Rihanna's Fenty Beauty line.</li>
                    <li>I loved products like the Match Stix Contour Skinsticks and Bright Fix eye brightener.</li>
                    <li>I wouldn't recommend Fenty Beauty's Pro Filt'r soft-matte longwear foundation or Stunna Lip
                        Paints.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">For the past seven years, Fenty Beauty by Rihanna has stood the test of
                    time — a rarity among celebrity beauty brands.
                </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">The musician launched Fenty Beauty in 2017 and, according to Vogue, it had
                    $100 million in sales within 40 days of its launch. Forbes estimated in 2021 that the brand was
                    worth $2.8 billion. </p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Even now, I find it hard hard to scroll through TikTok without stumbling
                    upon an influencer raving about Fenty Beauty's latest product. Although I agree many of them are
                    pretty great, not all of them live up to the hype. </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">As a beauty reporter, I've tested every type of Fenty Beauty product. A few
                    have become staples in my makeup bag, but others were a hard pass. </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Here are some that impressed me and a few that didn't.</p>
                <h1> Hella Thicc volumizing mascara checks all of the boxes for me.</h1>

                <img src="../assets/img/core-img/fenty-2.webp" loading="lazy" class="cruise__image" alt="">
                <p class="cruise_alt ">The Fenty Beauty Hella Thicc volumizing mascara has won me over.
                </p>
                <h1> Hella Thicc volumizing mascara ($19)</h1>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">I didn't love Fenty Beauty's initial mascara launch, Full Frontal Volume,
                    lift and curl mascara. It didn't do anything special for my lashes, and I could name several other
                    cheaper mascaras I liked way better. </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Fortunately, Hella Thicc changed my opinion on the brand's ability to
                    create a decent mascara. The first time I tested it, I was shocked at how well it separated my
                    lashes, making them instantly look fuller with a few swipes.</p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">The ultra-creamy texture lifted my lashes without weighing them down or
                    clumping them together. Overall, I really liked how dramatic my eyes looked after using this
                    mascara. </p>

                <h1> I get why Fenty Beauty's contour sticks are so popular.</h1>
                <img src="../assets/img/core-img/fenty-3.webp" loading="lazy" class="cruise__image" alt="">
                <p class="cruise_alt ">I use a Fenty Beauty Match Stix Contour Skinstick to shape my face and nose.
                </p>

                <h1>Match Stix Contour Skinstick ($32)</h1>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">The Match Stix Contour Skinstick is one of Fenty Beauty's bestsellers, and
                    for very good reason — it's a great product. </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">The cream-to-powder formula glides effortlessly onto my skin, making it
                    easy for me to use it for contouring to create the illusion of a chiseled jawline or sculpted
                    cheekbones in seconds.
                </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">"The only downside I've found with this product is its chubby design makes
                    it difficult to use when contouring my nose area. For a more precise application, I have to swipe
                    some product onto a small blending blush.
                </p>
                <h1> I was impressed with Fenty's We're Even concealer the first time I tried it.</h1>
                <img src="../assets/img/core-img/fenty-4.webp" loading="lazy" class="cruise__image" alt="">
                <p class="cruise_alt ">The We're Even hydrating longwear concealer comes in 50 shades.
                </p>
                <h1> We're Even hydrating longwear concealer ($30)</h1>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Creamy and thick, the We're Even hydrating concealer offers excellent
                    coverage. Despite the formula's thickness, I feel like it helps me blur my imperfections without
                    making my face look cake-y.
                </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">"A little bit of this medium-coverage concealer goes a long way, so I
                    recommend applying a thin layer and building up as needed.
                </p>

                <h1> Fenty Beauty's Cheeks Out Freestyle cream blush is one of my go-to products. </h1>
                <img src="../assets/img/core-img/fenty-5.webp" loading="lazy" class="cruise__image" alt="">
                <p class="cruise_alt ">Cheeks Out Freestyle cream blush comes in a few shades.
                </p>
                <h1>Cheeks Out Freestyle cream blush ($26)</h1>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Fenty Beauty's Cheeks Out Freestyle cream blush helps me achieve a good,
                    flushed look, even on minimal-makeup days.</p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Cream blushes like these are great because you can swipe them on with your
                    fingers and blend them out with little effort when in a hurry.</p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">I specifically love Fenty Beauty's extra-creamy Freestyle formulation,
                    which is highly pigmented and stays put on my face for hours. My favorite shade is Riri, a soft rosy
                    mauve.</p>

                <h1>The brand's eye brightener has impressed me, too.</h1>
                <img src="../assets/img/core-img/fenty-5.webp" loading="lazy" class="cruise__image" alt="">
                <p class="cruise_alt ">Stores like Sephora sometimes have tester options of the eye brightener so you
                    can see which shade will work for you.
                </p>
                <h1>Bright Fix eye brightener ($28)</h1>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Fenty Beauty's Bright Fix eye brightener has a ball-tipped applicator that
                    provides an almost cooling effect when placed under your eyes. It feels especially nice and
                    refreshing on mornings when I'm tired. </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">I do feel like the product helps me hydrate and brighten the skin under my
                    eyes so I can achieve a wide-awake look on a Monday morning after a busy weekend</p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Plus, Bright Fix comes in a practical squeeze tube I can throw in my purse
                    without taking up too much space. My favorite shade is Crepe.</p>
                <h1>On the other hand, the Pro Filt'r soft-matte longwear foundation is probably my least favorite
                    product in the entire line.</h1>

                <img src="../assets/img/core-img/fenty-6.webp" loading="lazy" class="cruise__image" alt="">
                <p class="cruise_alt ">Pro Filt'r soft-matte longwear foundation comes in way more shades than what's
                    pictured here.
                </p>
                <h1>Pro Filt'r soft-matte longwear foundation ($40)</h1>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">I prefer a foundation that offers good coverage and lasts all day — and
                    Fenty Beauty's Pro Filt'r soft-matte longwear foundation let me down. It's probably my
                    least-favorite Fenty Beauty product. </p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Although it lasted several hours when I tested it, I found the foundation
                    felt way too drying for my skin. It only seemed to highlight my dry patches, fine lines, and
                    blemishes — all of which I try to use foundation to hide.
                </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">You might want to give this foundation a try if you don't need a lot of
                    coverage and are just looking to even out your skin tone a bit. It might also work better for those
                    with oily or combination skin.
                </p>


                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Despite not loving this product, I did enjoy using the shade-finder tool on
                    the Fenty Beauty website. It uses AI technology to analyze a selfie and help shoppers find their
                    ideal foundation shade.
                </p>

                <h1> I wanted to love the Stunna Lip Paints but they fell short. </h1>
                <img src="../assets/img/core-img/fenty-7.webp" loading="lazy" class="cruise__image" alt="">
                <p class="cruise_alt ">Fenty Beauty's Stunna Lip Paints didn't win me over or last well on my lips.
                </p>
                <h1>Stunna Lip Paint longwear fluid lip color ($29)</h1>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Fenty Beauty's Stunna Lip Paints have adorable packaging — each comes in
                    what looks like a mini nail-polish bottle.
                </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">I was especially excited to try the shade Uncuffed, which I thought was the
                    perfect mauve color. Sadly, this product was a pass for me, as I found it was very messy and the
                    color transferred too easily.
                </p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph"> The first time I wore it, my lip color ended on my teeth, above my lips,
                    and on the sleeve of my shirt within minutes of applying it. Nothing is as embarrassing as being at
                    your child's PTA meeting and having another mom tell you your lipstick is everywhere.
                </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">I also didn't think this product was long-lasting, even when I took extra
                    caution not to let anything touch my lips while it dried. Most of the color on my lips faded soon
                    after I applied it.
                </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Overall, I think $29 is too pricey for a lip color, let alone one that
                    doesn't stay put.
                </p>
