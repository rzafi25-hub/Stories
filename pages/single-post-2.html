            <div class="cruise__content">
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Bill Belichick's girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, just nonchalantly held a
                    contest and gave away prizes to the winners on social media.</p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">The 24-year-old former Bridgwater State University cheerleader posted the challenge on her Instagram story on Wednesday, telling her followers, "PRIZE to anyone who can tell me what MUSSELS have to do with this photograph."  </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Hudson wasn't lying when she said she was giving a prize to the person who answered the question correctly, and it turns out the contest had a heartfelt meaning.</p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">On Thursday, she announced on Instagram that over 1,000 people participated in the contest.</p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">"The overwhelming response was 'the color of the inside of a mussel shell is purple'. While the answer did in fact relate to the pictured purple material, this was not the correct answer," Hudson told her followers. </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">"Sooooooo… what’s with the mussel harvesting paraphernalia? Let me explain. Purple bushel bags are a hallmark of my childhood," she said.</p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">The 24-year-old explained that her father was a mussel dragger, so her family had hundreds of them scattered between their boat, their processing center, and yard.
                </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">"I remember when we slept on Miss Daisy, we would stack them up nice and thick to use as pillows (I remember them being comfortable but I’m not sure I’d think so now). Because I really, really fancied the rich indigo-ish-royal-purple color, I would carry one around as if it were a posh handbag," she added. "I would even use them to make little dresses for my Polly Pockets and Barbies."</p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Belichick's girlfriend is the proud daughter of a Maine fisherman and posts regularly on social media about her family's roots and marine sustainability. </p>
                
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Earlier this month, she attended the Maine Fisherman Forum as the federal funding program was cut. The Trump administration has since agreed to renegotiate the funding. </p>
                <h1>Bill Belichick's relationship with Jordon Hudson</h1>

                </div>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Belichick, 72, has been making headlines in recent months - not only for accepting the job as head coach of the UNC football team after winning eight Super Bowls - but also for dating Hudson, who is 48-years younger than him. </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">The couple had a chance meeting in February 2021 when they were seated near each other on a flight. Hudson was a college student at the time and asked the former NFL coach to sign one of her textbooks. 

                </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Hudson shared a post on Instagram on February 11 acknowledging the first time she met him. </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">"Happy Meetiversary," she wrote. "Cheers to the fact that you still let me give you lengthy philosophical lectures four years later."</p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">The age difference between the couple was brought up several times during the Tom Brady roast on Netflix, "The Greatest Roast of All Time: Tom Brady," which aired in May 2024.  </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">"Coach, you used to talk about Foxborough High School when we sucked," former New England Patriot Rob Gronkowski said during the roast. "But now I know why you were so obsessed with Foxborough High School: you were scouting your new girlfriend." </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">After rumors about their romance started circulating, Hudson seemingly went Instagram official with Belichick in September 2024 when she shared pictures of the two of them petting a goat together. </p>
                <h1>Defending the age gap</h1>
                <div class="cruise__image-wrapper">

                </div>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">The couple has received a fair share of criticism for the age difference since their relationship went viral. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="cruise__paragraph">
                    On February 14, several people commented on a photo Hudson shared on Instagram . 
</p>
<p class="cruise__paragraph">
In the image, the 24-year-old was dressed in a long silver gown and was snuggled beside Belichick, who was seated in a chair with his hands crossed. 
</p>
<p class="cruise__paragraph">
One person wrote, "I can guarentee you Jordan that if Bill Belichick worked at Walmart and he approached you and asked you out on a date you'd have called the cops on him."
</p>
<p class="cruise__paragraph">
Another person said, "Honey, you’re with him because he’s loaded. He’s old enough to be your grandpa. Have a little respect for yourself."
</p>
<p class="cruise__paragraph">
A third person commented, "If that man were broke - you would be running in the other direction. Strategic - yes."
</p>
<p class="cruise__paragraph">
Someone else said, "Omg, stopppp, you’re not fooling anyone. You love that he’s old and rich. The Anna Nicole Smith special."
</p>
<p class="cruise__paragraph">
While it's undeniable that Hudson and Belichick have received plenty of flack for their romance, they've also received some support. 
One person commented on the same post, "I love this and I love how much you love your man. To be cherished and defended that way is the gift of a lifetime."
</p>
<p class="cruise__paragraph">
Another person said, "Congrats! So many hurtful comments. Be happy! God bless!"
</p>
<p class="cruise__paragraph">
Someone else wrote, "Live your life, don't mind the haters." 
</p>
<p class="cruise__paragraph">
Although Belichick hasn't acknowledged the age gap with his much younger girlfriend, Hudson regularly hits back at haters who mentions it.
</p>
<p class="cruise__paragraph">
After receiving a slew of negative comments post she shared on Instagram on Super Bowl Sunday, Hudson tagged Belichick and reminded him that she promised to take heat for him in 2025. 
"Hey @billbelichick remember that thing I said about taking punches for you in 2025? Check out this comment section…….. it’s only February."
</p>
<p class="cruise__paragraph">
She included several hashtags in the post, including "#KeepSwinging," "LoveIsStrongerThanHate," and "WhatHappenedToLoveIsLove."
