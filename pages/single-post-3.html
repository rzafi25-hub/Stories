            <div class="cruise__content">
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Tom Brady's rumored girlfriend, Irina Shayk, stepped out in a sexy look at a carnival in Brazil on Monday. 
                </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">The carnival was at a champion Samba school in Rio de Janeiro. </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">At the event, 39-year-old Shayk showed off her toned body in a two-piece outfit covered in sapphire crystals that exposed her stomach. She paired her blue bralette with a tiny skirt covered in beaded fringe. She accessorized with a matching headpiece, thigh-high gladiator heels, and an embellished chain around her stomach.</p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">The 39-year-old shared a post of the look to Instagram on Tuesday with the caption, "Pinch me, this is a dream!"</p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">"I can't believe this is real... Brazil, thank you so much for the love you gave me," Shayk continued.

                <h1>Tom Brady and Irina Shayk dating rumors</h1>
                <br>
                
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Sources say Brady and Shayk have quietly rekindled their romance recently.</p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">"Tom and Irina have started dating each other again and are open to see where things go," a source told "Page Six" in an article published on February 21. </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Another source told "Life & Style" that the pair recently got their "spark" back. </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">"The timing was off before," the source said. "Neither of them was fully over their exes when they first got together. Now, they're both in better head spaces," they said, adding, "Whatever spark they had two years ago is back."</p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Brady and the retired Victoria's Secret Angel were first linked in August 2023 after being spotted at a London hotel together. The couple reportedly met at billionaire Joe Nahmad's wedding to model Madison Headrick in Sardinia, Italy, a few months prior.</p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">At the time, "People Magazine" reported that Brady invited Shayk to fly out and meet up with him in Los Angeles, and she took him up on the offer. </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">It didn't take long for pictures of the meetup to go viral. However, the situationship fizzled out less than four months after it began, according to "Page Six". </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Shayk was previously in a relationship with actor Bradley Cooper, with whom she shares a daughter. The couple split in 2019. </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Brady hit the singles market in October 2022 after his divorce was finalized from model Gisele Bundchen, whom he shares two children with, Benjamin, 15, and Vivian, 12. The seven-time Super Bowl champion also has a son, Jack, with his ex-girlfriend, actress Bridget Moynahan.   </p>
