                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Hundreds of football players waited their entire lives to hear their name called in the 2025 NFL draft.  
                </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Every rookie who made the cut this year were obviously ecstatic to learn that they're officially joining a professional team, even if they were predicting that it would happen. Some of this year's draft inductees are expected to make an immediate impact in the league, while others will get a shot to prove themselves, and most importantly, continue playing the game they love for a bit longer. </p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph"> While we'll have to wait and see who makes the biggest splash in the league, we can simmer on some of the best reactions from this year's draft. Some of the draft inductees got extremely emotional after hearing their names called, while others had an epic reaction that we won't forget anytime soon.   </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Here are the top 10 reactions in the 2025 NFL draft. </p>

                <h1> 10. Luther Burden (Chicago Bears)</h1>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">University of Missouri wide receiver Luther Burden III had the best reaction to hearing his name called as the No. 39 overall in the 2025 NFL draft. The Chicago Bears took the Mizzou standout, who led the Tigers with 676 yards on 71 catches last year, which was the third-most by any SEC player, in the second round. </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">In a video shared by the Bears on <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/p/DI5Lur8M354/" target = "_blank"> Instagram</a>, Burden remained completely composed with the biggest smile on his face when he received the call from executive Ryan Poles, who told him he had made it into the NFL. "You sick of waiting," Poles asked the former Mizzou star, to which Burden replied calmly, "I've been waiting awhile." Poles replied, "I know you have."</p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Burden then told head coach Ben Johnson, "I'm ready to go. Let's do it," and told Bears coach Antwaan Randle El  it was a "dream come true." </p>
                
                <h1> 9. Barryn Sorrell (Green Bay Packers)</h1>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Barryn Sorrell was determined to have his once-in-a-lifetime moment on stage, regardless of how long it took. After sitting in the draft room without being picked for two days, the Texas defensive lineman's exciting moment came on day three when he sat in the green room alone before being selected as the No. 124 overall pick in the fourth round.  </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">The Packers didn't even know Sorrell was present for the big moment. He surprised them, along with everybody at Lambeau Field, when he walked across the stage after NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said, "This young man is here today."   
                </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">"What a cool moment that was," said the Packers director of football operations, Milt Hendrickson, according to ESPN. "We did not know he was here. That wasn't the reason we picked him, just some things are just meant to be. Pretty cool moment for him and the organization as well." 
                </p>
                <h1>  8. Will Howard (Pittsburgh Steelers)</h1>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Will Howard broke down into tears after he learned that the Pittsburgh Steelers selected him as the 185th overall pick in the sixth round of the draft. The former national championship-winning quarterback for Ohio State embraced his mother, Maureen, and other family members after he learned his fate, but what happened next was one of the best reactions we saw this year. Howard, along with his entire family, took a cold plunge in his family's pool to celebrate. 
                </p> <p class="cruise__paragraph">"What's up Steelers nation, just jumped in the pool with my family to celebrate. Can't wait to be a part of this. Can't wait to get to Pittsburgh and get started. Let's go," Howard said in a video shared by the Steelers on <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/reel/DI7GvxWS4HT/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D" target = "_blank"> Instagram</a>.

                <h1> 7. Travis Hunter (Jacksonville Jaguars) </h1>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">One of the biggest names in this year's draft, Colorado wide receiver and cornerback Travis Hunter, had an epic reaction to being selected as the 2nd overall pick by the Jacksonville Jaguars. Wearing a bright pink blazer paired with black pants, Hunter danced up a storm as he strutted excitedly onto the draft stage with a huge smile on his face.  </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">After he completed his walk of fame, Hunter was all about supporting his friend and teammate, Shedeur Sanders, who was still sitting in wait. Clearly showing the true nature of his supportive personality, Hunter told a reporter he was trying to hurry up during his post-draft interview, as he didn't want to miss Shedeur's name being called. If that's now a class act, we don't know what is. </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">We're rooting for this Cinderella story anyway. </p>

                <h1> 6. Shedeur Sanders (Cleveland Browns) </h1>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Speaking of Shedeur, the Colorado quarterback was among the most talked-about players in the 2025 NFL draft. Surprisingly, the son of NFL Hall of Fame legend Deion Sanders wasn't picked up until the fifth round of the draft on Saturday. However, despite the long wait, he had an epic reaction after learning he was finally selected as the No. 144 pick. </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">During a live video streamed on Twitch, Shedeur and his older brother Shilo Sanders - who was picked up as a free agent by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after the draft ended - danced up a storm to celebrate the news. Shedeur then took a cold plunge, jumping into his family's pool.  </p>
               <h1> 5. Cam Skattebo (New York Giants)  </h1>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Cam Skattebo had an emotional response to being drafted by the NFL Giants at No. 105. The Arizona State star runningback, who was surrounded by family when the news dropped, broke down in tears upon hearing his selection news in the fourth round.   </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">The 23-year-old will join a running back room with fifth-rounder Tyrone Tracy Jr. and veteran Devin Singletary. “One of our favorite players in the draft,” Giants general manager Joe Schoen said of the Sun Devils standout. “The way he plays, the mentality he plays with, the toughness, the competitiveness, the grit.”  </p>
                <h1> 4. Tyler Booker (Dallas Cowboys) </h1>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Tyler Booker had an unforgettable reaction when the Dallas Cowboys selected him at the 12th overall pick in the first round. The Alabama offensive lineman had such a hard time containing his excitement that he picked up his former teammate, Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe, and carried him across the green room as he shouted in excitement before walking across the draft stage.  
                </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Booker is the highest-picked offensive lineman the Cowboys have picked up in a draft since they took Tyron Smith at No. 9 back in 2011.    .
                </p>

                <h1> 3. Tyler Shough (New Orleans Saints)  </h1>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Louisville quarterback Tyler Shough, selected as the 40th pick by the New Orleans Saints, went viral when his golden retriever, Murphy, stole the show immediately after he was drafted. The adorable pup went wild, jumping onto the couch and photobombing the exciting moment. The draft broadcast event shared footage of Murphy's tail-wagging celebration with his family.   
                </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Shough was prepared to share his big moment with his loved ones and beloved pooch. After he was drafted, he revealed that he purchased bandanas for each team in the NFL for Murphy, whom he named after Jessica Chastain's character in the 2014 movie "Intersteller."     .
                </p>
                <h1> 2. Maxwell Hairston (Buffalo Bills) </h1>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Kentucky cornerback Maxwell Hairston made headlines during the 2025 draft for being one of the biggest supporters of the rookies in the green room this year. Before his own name was called by the Buffalo Bills at pick No. 30 in the first round, Hairston dabbed up all the players selected before him, showing a huge wave of support for his peers.   
                </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Rather than being upset over being passed on, the Kentucky standout congratulated the other draftees while he continued waiting behind the scenes. It took nearly three hours to hear his name called, however, Hairston was clearly overjoyed when he got his turn to walk across the draft stage.     .
                </p>
                <h1>1. Benjamin Morrison (Tampa Bay Buccaneers) </h1>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph"> Notre Dame cornerback Benjamin Morrison arguably had the best reaction after hearing his name called in the second round of the 2025 NFL draft. The emotional response happened after Morrison learned he would be selected as the 53rd overall pick by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.  
                </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">During a phone call with the team's head coach, Todd Bowles, Morrison burst into tears, which was caught on a now-viral video shared by the Buccaneers. "The best Draft call reaction you'll see all weekend," the Buccs captioned the post.     .
                </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">"Thank you for believing in me," Morrison said, tears streaming down his face, during the recorded call. "Man, I'm not going to let you down, man. I promise you," he said. "Thank you so much."  "The best Draft call reaction you'll see all weekend," the Buccs captioned the post.     .
                </p>
