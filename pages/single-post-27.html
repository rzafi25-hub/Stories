                <h1>A MISSING 12-year-old girl's home has appeared empty in eerie new pictures taken by The U.S. Sun
                    nine months after she vanished.</h1>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">The last confirmed sighting of Madalina Cojocari was getting off the
                    school bus in her Cornelius, North Carolina neighborhood - which is about 20 miles north of uptown
                    Charlotte - on November 21, 2022, according to police. </p>

                <h1>The missing 12-year-old's home appeared dark and empty in eerie new photographs taken by The U.S.
                    Sun on Friday, prior to the girl's stepdad being released from jail</h1>

                <img src="../assets/img/core-img/stketch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="img" class="cruise__image">
                <h1>A missing person sign with Madalina's photos has been staked into the ground at the front of her
                    North Carolina neighborhood</h1>

                <h1>
                    STEPDAD COMES HOME
                </h1>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph"> Madalina's stepfather, Christopher Palmiter, was released on $25,000 bond
                    on Friday.
                </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Electronic monitoring was part of Palmiter's secure bond agreement, and
                    he's already turned over his passport, according to his attorney, Brandon Roseman's, statement to
                    the judge at Thursday's hearing.</p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">The attorney told the judge that Palmiter would be unable to "float" the
                    mortgage on the Victoria Bay house much longer if remained in jail. </p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">After listening to the attorney's arguments, the judge agreed to lower the
                    bond from $200,000 to $25,000, and Palmiter was released the next evening.</p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Her mother, Diana, is being held on $250,000 bond at a Charlotte jail on
                    Failure to Report a Child Disappearance charges.</p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Palmiter was seen returning to the family's Cornelius home - for the first
                    time in nine months - after he was released on bond, according to local NBC affiliate WCNC.</p>
                <h1>DARK AND VACANT</h1>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">A few hours before Palmiter's arrival, The U.S. Sun observed the eerie
                    house, which appeared to be dark and vacant.</p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">There was no sign of anybody living in the house.</p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">The two-story brick home had all of the blinds pulled closed on the
                    windows, and there were no cars in the driveway or coming and going from the house.</p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">A white swing on Madalina's front porch was moving gently in the breeze,
                    and a constant flow of traffic was seen entering and exiting the quiet suburban neighborhood.</p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">None of the vehicles stopped at Madalina's house though.</p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">"Several minivans and SUVs on a neighboring street were bustling with
                    parents' getting children in and out of the car.</p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">And children's bicycles and kids' shoes were seen strewn on neighboring
                    front porches signaling the pitter-patter of other small feet in the neighborhood.</p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Not at Madalina's home though.</p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">It remained dark and quiet the entire morning.</p>
                <h1>HER NEIGHBOR'S WON'T FORGET</h1>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">The U.S. Sun spoke to several of Madalina's neighbors on Friday, who all
                    said they're continuing to follow the little girl's story.</p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">It was a mutual consensus that everyone is hoping her story will have a
                    happy ending.</p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Several neighbors described it as simply: "Sad," and "Tragic."</p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Many of Madalina's neighbors still have yellow ribbons tied to their
                    mailboxes in honor of the missing 12-year-old.</p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">One neighbor told The U.S. Sun some neighbors have taken the ribbons down,
                    as they're starting to fade and fall apart after being displayed for nine months and counting.</p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Dozens of homes have the ribbons up anyway though.</p>


                <p class="cruise__paragraph">They serve as a sign of hope and support for the missing girl, a neighbor
                    said.</p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">However, there was not a yellow ribbon tied to Madalina's mailbox.

                </p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">A no trespassing sign was, however, hung on Madalina's front porch window.
                </p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">The sign warns visitors that they are being monitored and recorded on
                    video.</p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">It is not clear if that sign was present on the home's front window prior
                    to Madalina disappearance.</p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Madalina's mother, Diana Cojocari, and stepfather, Christopher Palmiter
                    have maintained that they don't know where she is, per unsealed search warrants.</p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">They were the only two people living in the home with her at the time of
                    her disappearance.</p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">The couple waited weeks to report Madalina missing, and police have said
                    they know more than they're saying.</p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Police have said they're still actively searching for Madalina with the
                    help of the FBI and SBI.</p>
