            </div>


            <div class="cruise__content">
                <ul class="cruise__content-list">
                    <li>On my first African safari trip, I'm glad we purchased an all-inclusive meal package.</li>
                    <li>The Ngorongoro Crater was worth visiting, and I'm glad we took a charter flight to the
                        Serengeti.</li>
                    <li>If I went on the trip again, I wouldn't stop in Zanzibar. It was pretty but not relaxing.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">I'm not the type of girl who enjoys camping, and I'm unashamed to admit
                    that I like to see the comforts of bathrooms and air conditioning when I travel.
                </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">So, I was very open to splurging on extras and upgrades when I went on a
                    safari trip to Tanzania, Africa, and visited the Serengeti, Ngorongoro Crater, and Zanzibar in June.
                    However, not every booking choice I made is one I'd make again. </p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Here are the five things that were worth it on this trip and the one thing
                    I'd skip next time. </p>
                <h1> Booking our trip through a local travel agency saved me a lot of stress.</h1>

                <img src="../assets/img/core-img/safaris-2.webp" loading="lazy" class="cruise__image" alt="">
                <p class="cruise_alt ">I had a positive experience booking my trip through Colours of Africa
                </p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">As an avid traveler, I've booked many trips without a travel agent. </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">However, I felt I was over my head when starting to plan my first trip to
                    Africa. Navigating transportation transfers, vaccine requirements, hotel bookings, and excursions
                    felt overwhelming.</p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">So, after reading many positive reviews, I booked with a Tanzania-based
                    tour agency, Colours of Africa. The agency handled a lot of logistics and took all the stress out of
                    planning for me. </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Plus, when the airline lost our luggage, the agency staff were a huge help.
                    They took us shopping for
                    essentials and made sure our belongings were delivered to us as soon as they were located.</p>

                <h1> I'm glad we took a small charter plane to the Serengeti.</h1>
                <img src="../assets/img/core-img/safaris-3.webp" loading="lazy" class="cruise__image" alt="">
                <p class="cruise_alt ">We stopped at Serengeti National Park
                </p>


                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Many safaris take place in remote areas that aren't easy to reach.</p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">To get from Mt. Kilimanjaro to Serengeti National Park, we had the choice
                    to take a one-hour direct charter flight or drive six hours.
                </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Although driving would've likely been cheaper, we chose the $145 flight. It
                    saved us a lot of time, and it was really cool to see the park (and some zebras) from above as we
                    landed.
                </p>
                <h1>Going out of our way to see the Ngorongoro Crater was worth it.</h1>
                <img src="../assets/img/core-img/safaris-4.webp" loading="lazy" class="cruise__image" alt="">
                <p class="cruise_alt ">The Ngorongoro Crater was incredible.
                </p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">The Ngorongoro Crater is in a very remote part of Tanzania. It took us
                    about two and a half hours of driving to get to the area from the Serengeti, but the trek was worth
                    it.
                </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">"The crater and our nearby luxury hotel, the Grand Melia, had some of the
                    most breathtaking views I've ever seen. I was also fascinated learning about the local Masai culture
                    from our guide.
                </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Plus, I really wanted to see lions with long manes during our trip and the
                    crater was the only place
                    I saw them.</p>

                <h1>We found value in upgrading to an all-inclusive meal package.</h1>
                <img src="../assets/img/core-img/safaris-5.webp" loading="lazy" class="cruise__image" alt="">
                <p class="cruise_alt ">We ate many meals at our resort.
                </p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">I'm always a fan of all-inclusive meal packages, especially on safari trips
                    with limited or no nearby off-resort dining options.</p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Once we did the math, we found the all-inclusive meal plan at our main
                    resort was a better value than paying for our food à la carte.</p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Plus, the prepaid package allowed us to feel less stressed about budgeting
                    throughout the trip and to just enjoy our food.</p>

                <h1>Paying for lounge access for our long layover was worth it.</h1>
                <img src="../assets/img/core-img/safaris-6.webp" loading="lazy" class="cruise__image" alt="">
                <p class="cruise_alt ">We paid for Kenya Airways lounge access during our trip.
                </p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Long layovers can be brutal and tough to avoid when going from the United
                    States to remote parts of Africa.</p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">To make our 10-hour layover in Nairobi more bearable, we paid for Kenya
                    Airways lounge access, which I highly recommend. Five hours of access can cost about $40 per person.
                </p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Although the lounge wasn't perfect, it had air conditioning, and we
                    appreciated the complimentary food and drinks.</p>
                <h1>However, I'd skip our stop in Zanzibar next time.
                </h1>

                <img src="../assets/img/core-img/safaris-7.webp" loading="lazy" class="cruise__image" alt="">
                <p class="cruise_alt ">Zanzibar had some pretty views, but it wasn't for us.
                </p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">We originally thought it'd be nice to end our long journey with a few beach
                    days in Zanzibar, an archipelago known for its beautiful beaches and spice production. </p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">A few beach days seemed like the perfect, relaxing ending to our long
                    journey, but that wasn't the case.
                </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Unfortunately, our resort was on a public beach that felt jam-packed from
                    morning to night. We couldn't step foot off the resort property onto the beach without being
                    approached by individuals selling items or drinks.
                </p>


                <p class="cruise__paragraph">We also stopped by Stone Town, which was a fairly long ride from our
                    resort. It had shops and spice tours, but there wasn't a ton we wanted to do in the city — so it
                    didn't seem worth the visit for us, either.
                </p>
