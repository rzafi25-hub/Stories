            <div class="cruise__content">

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">The drug epidemic has taken a toll in West Virginia. The state leads the
                    country in the rate of drug overdose deaths, and one in every five babies in West Virginia is born
                    substance-exposed, according to the non-profit organization To The Moon and Back.</p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">A secondary effect of the epidemic that doesn’t grab national headlines is
                    the staggering number of grandparents raising their grandchildren when their own children are unable
                    to do so – typically because of a drug addiction.</p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">West Virginia ranks second in the country for percentage of grandparents
                    raising grandchildren, according to Bonnie Dunn, extension specialist at West Virginia State
                    University.</p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Mississippi is ranked first, and West Virginia is close behind, says Dunn.
                </p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">“It’s not a respecter of person. It’s the rich and the in-between
                    experiencing this,” she says. “It crosses all demographics. You have doctors, lawyers, dentists.
                    You’ve got pastors. You’ve got a whole sundry of people.”</p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Dunn says she’s seeing not only grandparents raise grandchildren, but also
                    great-grandparents, some of whom are in their 80s, raising their great-grandchildren.</p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">She estimates that more than 35,000 children in the state are being raised
                    by grandparents. The non-profit organization To the Moon and Back says 43,000 West Virginia children
                    are known to live in primary custody of their grandparents.</p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Monroe County resident Dreama Hoke is one of these grandparents.</p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Shortly after her daughter gave birth, a hospital worker asked Hoke if she
                    would take in her granddaughter Jaylah, who was born having been exposed to drugs in her mother’s
                    womb.</p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Today Jaylah is 7 years old, and Hoke is still raising her.</p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">“It was really hard because we didn’t know that our daughter used drugs. We
                    had no idea,” said Hoke.</p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">She says she later found out her daughter started using in high school,
                    which was even more surprising.</p>
