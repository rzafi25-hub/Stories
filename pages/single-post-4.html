            <div class="cruise__content">
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">LeBron James turned heads at Wednesday night's Los Angeles Lakers game against the Denver Nuggets, and it wasn't due to his performance on the basketball court. 
                </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">The four-time NBA Most Valuable Player, currently out with a groin injury, showed up to Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, rocking a custom NHL Columbus Blue Jackets jersey. The 40-year-old NBA star, who grew up in Akron, Ohio - about two hours north of Columbus - accessorized the blue and red jersey with a hat worn backward and two silver necklaces. </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">While fans tried to focus on the game, they couldn't help but comment on the NBA player's fashion choice. </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">One person commented on a video of the fit shared by ESPN on X, "LeBron's jersey collab - ice-cold heat."</p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Another person wrote, "This might actually make LeBron the goat. What a power move." </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Someone else commented, "the collab we never knew we needed."</p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Another person said, "That jersey is [fire emojis]."  </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Even the Blue Jackets commented on the look. </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">"No debate: LeBron is the [goat emoji]," the NHL team wrote in a post on X. </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">The Blue Jackets are no stranger to the arena the Lakers played in last night. The team has split their series in the 2024-25 NHL regular season with the Lakers' co-tenants, the Los Angeles Kings. </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">The Columbus team is currently on a four-time losing streak. They face the reigning Stanley Cup champions, the Florida Panthers, at Nationwide Arena in Columbus on Thursday. </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">While the Blue Jackets haven't had the most luck recently, the Lakers won their third game in a row on Wednesday with a final score of 120-108. </p>

                <h1>When will James return to the Lakers? </h1>
                <br>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">According to ESPN reporter Shams Charania, James had his first on-court workout since suffering a groin injury on March 16 but isn't expected to play in another game for at least a week. </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Due to the fact that he's suffering from a soft tissue injury, the Lakers want to take extra caution and not rush his return to the court, Charania said. </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">James was injured in the matchup against the Boston Celtics on March 8 and has missed the Lakers' last six games. </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">After the game, he told reporters he possibly extended it a little bit too much when he was trying to move past Celtics guard Jaylen Brown on a scoring attempt near the end of the fourth quarter. </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">He had 14 rebounds, 22 points and nine assists in his 35 minutes of play in the matchup against the Celtics before he suffered the injury to his left groin. </p>
