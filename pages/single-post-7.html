            <div class="cruise__content">
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">The Kentucky Derby is less than 24 hours away, and horse racing fans are scrambling to predict this year's winner. 
                </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">The 2025 Run for the Roses will feature 20 of the world's top three-year-old thoroughbreds. </p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Most of the horses competing in the 151st Derby were purchased from anywhere between $600,000 and $1.2 million — except for one.  </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">There is a Cinderella story in this year's race that makes you want to put all of your money on him. His name is "Chunk of Gold." </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">The thoroughbred's owner purchased the stunning gray colt for $2,500, significantly less than all the horses competing in this year's race.  </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">His bargain price tag doesn't mean he shouldn't get good odds in the field though.</p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Chunk of Gold has some impressive pedigree in its blood. He's the son of Preservationalist, a Grade 1 winner who's won six races and has more than $1 million in career earnings.  </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">The thoroughbred's earnings are already a staggering $348,818, making him a hugely successful investment for his owners.  </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">The Kentucky Derby hopeful has delivered a few remarkable performances ahead of his bid to win the first leg of the Triple Crown on Saturday. He finished in second place in the Louisiana Derby and also in the Risen Star, a crucial stop on the road to the Derby.  
                </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">His second-place finish in the Risen Star was impressive, as his odds were 30-1. 
                </p>
                <h1> 'Chunk of Gold's breeder saw toughness in the colt shortly after he was born</h1>
                 <p class="cruise__paragraph">The Kentucky Breeder responsible for bringing Chunk of Gold into the world said they knew the colt had some fight in him shortly after he was born. 
                </p> <p class="cruise__paragraph">"He was a May 11 colt so we kept him back for October (sale) to give him some time to mature," said Bret Jones, president of Airdrie Stud, according to BloodHorse.com.  
                </p> <p class="cruise__paragraph">"This probably shouldn't be discussed but I'll honestly never forget him as a yearling because he tried multiple times to climb out of his stall over at Fasig! He would get up on his hind legs and actually got his front feet over the barrier a few times to the point of it being a serious worry." 
                </p> <p class="cruise__paragraph">He continued, "In hindsight, I'm choosing to attribute that behavior to him being a tough dude that wanted to show us he was the boss. Here's hoping that toughness comes through on Saturday." 
                </p> <p class="cruise__paragraph">Chunk of Gold's owner, Chris Melton, knew he got a steal when he bought the yearling.
                </p> <p class="cruise__paragraph">"I was going to go up to $20,000," said Melton. "When I got him for $2,500 I thought, uh oh, I've missed something. He was a little immature, but you could tell he was going to grow up and be good-looking horse, and he has."

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Chunk of Gold will have a bit of an uphill battle when he races in the Derby on Saturday night, as he will start from the 19th post.  </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">It's a long shot, as only one other horse, "I'll Have Another" in 2012, has won the Derby from that post. </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">We're rooting for this Cinderella story anyway. </p>

                <p class="cruise__paragraph">While Chunk of Gold was a great bargain, many of the 2025 Kentucky Derby hopefuls were acquired for hundreds of thousands of dollars. </p>


                <p class="cruise__paragraph">"Neoquos, who has a great starting position in the #2 hole on Saturday, is the second-cheapest horse in the race. He was purchased for $22,000. </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Only two other horses competing at Churchill Downs this year were purchased for under $100,000: Coal Battle, who was bought for $70,000, and Flying Mohawk, purchased for $72,000.  </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Sandman and Baeza are the two most expensive horses in this year's race, with both being purchased for $1.2 million.  </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">Predicted lead contender, Journalism, is the third most expensive horse in the race with an $825,000 pricetag. 
                </p>
                <p class="cruise__paragraph">The Kentucky Derby is scheduled to begin at 6:57 pm EST on Saturday, May 3.
